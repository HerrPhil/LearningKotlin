# Journey to Learn Kotlin

Here is an app to write kotlin code in.

## Github Configuration

The code was generated locally by Android Studio, from its templates.

I chose a "Basic Activity" app from the new project wizard.

I created the remote repository as per usual.

Except, Android Studio created the .gitignore for Android.

I skipped that file in the repository creation.
