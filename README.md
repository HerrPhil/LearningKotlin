# Journey to Learn Kotlin

Here is an app to write kotlin code in.

## Github Configuration

The code was generated locally by Android Studio, from its templates.

I chose a "Basic Activity" app from the new project wizard.

I created the remote repository as per usual.

Except, Android Studio created the .gitignore for Android.

I skipped that file in the repository creation.

## Learning about state of Android Studio on my MacBook Pro

I have encountered a resource deficit.

My laptop only has 16 GB of RAM.

When Android Studio launches, then it needs 2.3 GB of RAM.

When an emulator launches, then it needs approximately 7 GB of RAM.

The other apps needs from 6 GB to 9 GB, like Chrome.

Therefore Android Studio development is on hold.

I will not be able to use Android Studio as a way to learn Kotlin.

The average cost to upgrade to a modern MacBook Pro with enough memory
is between $3,500 and $4,600.
